# Indexed DB Futures

Wraps the [web_sys](https://crates.io/crates/web_sys) Indexed DB API in a Future-based API and removes the pain of dealing
with Javascript callbacks in Rust.

See root crate docs for usage instructions.

This is a very early release that hasn't been fully tested and is currently being tried out in a weekend project.

It is also the first library I've written in Rust - feedback is most welcome and the API may take on a different shape
in the library's v0.x phase.
